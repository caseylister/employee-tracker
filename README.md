## [Description](#Contents)
  
This application was made using node.js, inquirer, and mysql to create a company database soa business owner or members of a business may view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. 
  
## [Installation](#Contents)
  
To run this project, download the files or git clone it to your computer. Once that's done, use the command line to navigate to the root of the project. From there, type npm install. Once that's installed, you will need to install the inquirer package by running npm install express. You will also need to install mysql for this program to work. Do this by running the command npm install mysql2. Once these packages are downloaded, run node server from the command line and the program will run from there! :-)
  
## [Usage](#Contents)
  
After running node server from the command line, there will be a prompt to be used as a guide through the company database. You will be able to view and add employees, departments, and roles, update an employee's role, and delete an employee.
